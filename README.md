## About the project
In this project I attempt to create a web app using Flask, that displays the cafes available in Singapore, as well as other information that might be of interest, like the availability of charging ports.
# What I did
1. Used a SQL database to store information of various cafes
2. Created the frontend using HTML5 and CSS (as well as Bootstrap)
3. Created a login system with password hashing for administrators to add and delete cafes from the database
